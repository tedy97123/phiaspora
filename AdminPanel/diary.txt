1/21 -
   left off on Row3 on the list of Products section, I was working on adding a button 
   at the end of each row to show the transactions associated with the product in a modal.
   I was able to print out the productData obj, but left off on trying to extract the id
   I was only able to console.log(productData) but not when I clicked the associated row
   I should look at the Datagrid compoent in the middle of the return statement...

   Plan of action for 1/22
   Looked at some documentation and found this site; https://mui.com/x/api/data-grid/data-grid/.
   I was able to find component and the props that belong to the compoent. Do research on
   isCellEditable={} and isRowSelectable ={}

   was able to implement gloab statemanaggment with redux and update my store with the product object how i can access that state anywhere 
   like to view or edit modal.

   Plan of action for 1/23 
   Send productSlice to View/Edit Modal for either viewing or editing transactions picked!
